    		<h2>THANK YOU!!!</h2>
    		<p class="ty-container-paragraph">Thank you so much for your generous donation to Gardner Pilot Academy Foundation. We truly appreciate your commitment to the kids in our community. With your help, we've provided after school care to 300 kids this year. They're building healthy relationships with peers and adults, improving their grades, and having a great time in our after school programs. <br/>We couldn't do it without your help.
			<p>Thank you.</p>
			<p>Gardner Pilot Academy</p>
